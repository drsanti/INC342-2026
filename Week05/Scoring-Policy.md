# Programming Examination Scoring Policy

This policy applies to the **programming portion** of the course quizzes (Quiz 1, Quiz 2, Quiz 3). It describes how **submission order** affects your final score when AI tools are used.

---

## Overview

* **AI tools:** You may use Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools to help develop code during the programming examination. This is allowed to raise the level of challenge and to allow a clearer assessment of your competencies.
* **Submission order matters:** Your **submission time** is part of the evaluation. Completing and submitting **earlier** gives a score advantage.
* **How it works:** Your **base score** (from correctness and quality) is multiplied by a **score multiplier** that depends on your **order of submission**. The earlier you submit among all students, the higher the multiplier.

## Score Multipliers by Submission Order

Final score = **Base score × Multiplier** (based on submission order).

| Group   | Submission order | Score multiplier |
|---------|------------------|------------------|
| Group 1 | 1st – 7th        | **1.0**          |
| Group 2 | 8th – 15th       | **0.9**          |
| Group 3 | 16th and onward  | **0.8**          |

*Submission order is determined by the order in which valid submissions are received (e.g., by timestamp).*

---

## Examples

**Example 1**

* Submission order: **5th**
* Base score: **85** points  
* Multiplier: **1.0**  
* **Final score: 85 × 1.0 = 85 points**

---

**Example 2**

* Submission order: **12th**
* Base score: **85** points  
* Multiplier: **0.9**  
* **Final score: 85 × 0.9 = 76.5 points**

---

**Example 3**

* Submission order: **20th**
* Base score: **85** points  
* Multiplier: **0.8**  
* **Final score: 85 × 0.8 = 68 points**

## Summary

| Your submission rank | Multiplier | Effect on an 85-point base score |
|----------------------|------------|-----------------------------------|
| 1st – 7th            | 1.0        | 85 points                         |
| 8th – 15th           | 0.9        | 76.5 points                       |
| 16th or later        | 0.8        | 68 points                         |
