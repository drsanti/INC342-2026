## Course Description

This course covers the principles and applications of **embedded systems** for automation and control. Topics include **embedded system components** and architecture (16-bit Microchip CPUs, WiFi modules, board generations), **development environment setup** (CLI usage, TernionDevTools, IDE configuration), **firmware development** (development workflow, build/compile process, project structure), and **Embedded C programming fundamentals** (syntax, memory management, essential functions). The course also explores **event-driven programming** (events, callbacks, timers, state machines, ADC), **advanced Embedded C techniques** (standardized data types, pointers, memory management, `typedef`, data integrity), **microcontroller peripherals programming** (GPIO operations, register-level control), **program flow control and I/O manipulation** (conditional statements, Sensor-Controller-Actuator model, Digital/Analog I/O, bit manipulation), **code optimization strategies** (execution speed, memory/program length optimization, best practices), and **advanced programming techniques** (real-time timing, event-driven task scheduling, state machine architecture, modular peripheral control). Emphasis is placed on **hands-on programming** and **project-based learning** for real-world automation applications.
