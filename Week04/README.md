| File | Description |
|------|--------------|
| **[Week04-Read01.md](./Week04-Read01.md)** | **Reading (concepts)** — Periodic operations, LED control, switches and events, ADC. Setup (updates, project creation, board selection) and key concepts. |
| **[Week04-Read02.md](./Week04-Read02.md)** | **Code examples** — Full C code for EP8 (blinking/alternating LEDs), EP9 (switch callback), EP10 (ADC/LDR). Key functions and concepts in tables. |
| **[Week04-Test01.md](./Week04-Test01.md)** | **Self-test (concepts)** — Quiz based on Read01: periodic operations, events, ADC, project setup, Gen 1/2, jumper. |
| **[Week04-Test02.md](./Week04-Test02.md)** | **Self-test (code)** — Quiz based on Read02: `interval`, `gpio_set_level`, `switch_set_callback`, casting, `analog_read_raw`, `serial_printf`. |

**Suggested order:** Read01 → Read02 → Test01 → Test02 (or do both reads first, then both quizzes).
