# INC342: Embedded Systems and Applications

> This course introduces **embedded systems** and their applications in **measurement, control, and automation**. Students will gain both **theoretical knowledge** and **practical programming skills** through a progressive three-phase learning approach: **foundations** (embedded system concepts, development environment setup, firmware development, and event-driven programming), **embedded C programming** (advanced C techniques, pointers, memory management, and microcontroller peripherals), and **advanced techniques** (program flow control, I/O manipulation, code optimization, and advanced programming patterns). The course emphasizes **hands-on development** of **firmware applications** using **16-bit Microchip microcontrollers** and **Embedded C programming** for real-world automation and control applications.
