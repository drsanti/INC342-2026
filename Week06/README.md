# **Week 6: Embedded C Programming Fundamentals**

---

This directory contains the learning materials and assessment tasks for **Week 6**, focusing on the physical properties of variables, memory architecture, and professional firmware declaration standards.

## 📖 Reading Material
*   [**Week 6: C Variables and Memory Management**](./Wee06-Read02.md)
    *   Topics: Variable Categories, Overflow/Underflow, `sizeof()`, Memory Sections (Data/Stack/Heap), and `<stdint.h>`.

## 📋 Assessment & Quizzes
*   [**Quiz 2 – Part 1 (Theory)**](./Week02-Theory.md)
    *   30-45 minute paper-based assessment covering memory concepts and variable behavior.
*   [**Quiz 2 – Part 2 (Coding)**](./Week06-Coding.md)
    *   Hands-on coding tasks integrating memory mapping, ADC sampling, and hardware I/O (switches/LEDs).

## **Learning Objectives**
By the end of this week, students will be able to:
1.  Identify where variables live in memory (Data Section vs. Stack).
2.  Use `sizeof()` to verify variable footprints on a 16-bit architecture.
3.  Implement robust code that handles variable overflow and underflow.
4.  Apply fixed-width data types (`uint8_t`, `int16_t`, etc.) for portable firmware development.
5.  Use `typedef` to create descriptive and maintainable custom types.
